This entry shows that lawmakers appreciated receiving the briefings. Ambassador James Dobbins, the SRAP (Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan), would have been one of the key diplomats to engage in talks with foreign governments about efforts to resettle the Taliban Five.

That's a key statement, and the point of contention between Congress and the White House after it was disclosed that the Taliban Five were traded for Bergdahl. By law, the Pentagon is required to notify Congress about any transfers of detainees out of Guantanamo. But in the case of Bergdahl and the Taliban Five, the Pentagon and the administration claimed Bergdahl's welfare trumped the administration's legal obligations and acted unilaterally.`,

This entry, two years before Bergdahl's rescue, contains the first disclosure that committee members were opposed to the deal to trade the Taliban Five for Bergdahl. But the entry also notes that, according to then-SRAP Ambassador Marc Grossman, the US had not spoken with the Taliban for six months and a deal to trade the Taliban Five wasn't in the immediate offering. An important note here: Grossman told lawmakers that the administration might consider a deal in the future. Lawmakers requested Grossman commit to consulting them before a decision was made. He agreed. But the Obama administration broke that agreement when it rescued Bergdahl.`,
